A user may need some information that is only available at another account. How does this user access that information?

User ------------> Role -------------> AWS STS --------> Authentication --------> User ------------> Information

_AWS STS is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for IAM users or users that we authenticate (federated users)
_In other words, users can have temporary, limited-privilege credentials for accessing certain services.
_AWS STS is a global service, and they go to a single endpoint https://sts.amazonaws.com
_By default, all regions are enabled for STS but can be disabled.
