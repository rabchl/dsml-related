title: "Effective Project Planning"
---

1. The project lead **must** 
    - clearly define what needs to be achieved by the project
    - understand groups that can affect or be affected by the project.

2. The evaluations metrics need to be defined and agreed upon as they will be revisited during project evaluation.

3. Team members group together to discuss
    - individual responsabilities
    - how to achieve business objectives using available resources.

4. Establish the timeline, an estimate of how long the project would be.

5. Generate a playbook, a thorough description of how the project will be carried out and evaluated.
