Once the _feasibility_ of the project has been _confirmed by_ the MVP, it must be packaged into an FFP.

1. Polish up the MVP to build a production-ready deliverable with various optimizations
    - Introduce additional data preparation techniques to improve the quality of input data
    - Slightly augment the model pipeline for greater model performance if necessary

2. Reimplement the whole pipeline (data preparation and model training) on web services for higher throughput and quality.
    - AWS, for example.
