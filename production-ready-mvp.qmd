title: "Build Minimum Viable Products"

Assert directions is clear for everyone, then build a MVP.

1. Build a simplistic version of the deliverable that **_showcases the project's value_**.

2. Understand the project's difficulties and reject paths with greater risks or less promising outcomes
    - Use the _fail fast, fail often_ philosophy

3. Work with partially sampled datasets in development settings and ignore insignificant optimizations.
