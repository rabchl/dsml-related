## Data Warehouses

A data warehouse was designed to collect and consolidate the influx of data which was being generated and collected at high volumes and at a fast pace. 

- Main advantages
  - data is in a production-ready state for business intelligence and analytics
  - data is structured and cleaned
  - schemas are predefined

- Main disadvantages
  - they were not designed for semi-structured or unstructured data
  - they becomes very expensive if we try to store data that do not fit the schema (inflexible schemas)
  - they struggle with the volume, velocity, variety of big data and they usually take long processing time

## Data Lakes

In a data lake, structured, semi-structured and unstructured data can live simultaneously, collected in the volumes and speed necessary.

- Main advantages
  - Flexible data storages, multiple data types can be stored in it
  - Cost efficiency in the cloud allows data streaming
  - main disadvantages of data warehouses are solved

- Main disadvantages
  - Not support for transactional data
  - Do not enforce data quality, so data reliability is questionable since there are several formats 
  - Then, data governance is a challenge as well as data privacy enforcement

## Data [Lakehouses](https://www.databricks.com/research/lakehouse-a-new-generation-of-open-platforms-that-unify-data-warehousing-and-advanced-analytics)

- All use cases (predictive modeling, SQL, BI, streaming, etc.) within a single platform
- One security and governance approach for _all_ data assets on _all_ clouds
- Open and reliable arquitecture which combines the benefits of a data warehouse and a data lake to efficiently handle all data types
- It offers decoupled storage from compute, each operates on their own clusters, allowing them to scale independently to support specific needs


### Databricks Lakehouse Platform

Founded in 2013 by the creators of Apache Spark, Delta Lake and MLFlow. 

- Reliability and performance of Delta Lake
- Governance for data and AI with Unity Catalog
- Persona-based uses cases for all data team members
- Provides instant and serverless compute, the compute layer is provided and managed by Databricks
